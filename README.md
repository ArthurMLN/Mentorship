# Strategic Mentorship Goals for Professional Growth at MD Anderson

## 1. Expanding Professional Network
With MD Anderson prioritizing internal hires for key positions, it’s essential to expand connections across departments to increase visibility and career opportunities. Remote work has reduced natural networking chances, so establishing relationships with professionals in other areas is now a strategic priority. I hope my mentor can help by introducing me to key individuals or recommending relevant cross-departmental opportunities.

## 2. Gaining Strategic Insights for Future Preparedness
Understanding the perspectives of senior leadership on MD Anderson’s development is crucial for staying informed on the organization’s strategic direction. Early knowledge of key initiatives will allow proactive steps, such as consulting relevant departments or pursuing necessary certifications, to remain aligned with institutional goals. I would appreciate any guidance from my mentor on how to stay proactively aligned with strategic priorities and initiatives as they evolve, ensuring that I am well-prepared to support MD Anderson’s goals.

## 3. Developing Leadership Strategies for Team Effectiveness
Learning practical leadership techniques to address team dynamics and resolve specific issues effectively is a valuable growth area. Mentorship provides an opportunity to discuss challenges and gain insights into best practices for fostering a productive team environment. Additionally, it would be beneficial if my mentor could recommend opportunities for me to take on leadership responsibilities in collaborative projects to apply and refine these strategies.
