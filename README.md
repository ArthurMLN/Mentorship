# Strategic Mentorship Goals for Professional Growth at MD Anderson

## 1. Expanding Professional Network
With MD Anderson prioritizing internal hires for key positions, it’s essential to expand connections across departments to increase visibility and career opportunities. Remote work has reduced natural networking chances, so establishing relationships with professionals in other areas is now a strategic priority. I hope my mentor can help by introducing me to key individuals or recommending relevant cross-departmental opportunities.

## 2. Gaining Strategic Insights for Future Preparedness
Understanding the perspectives of senior leadership on MD Anderson’s development is crucial for staying informed on the organization’s strategic direction. Early knowledge of key initiatives will allow proactive steps, such as consulting relevant departments or pursuing necessary certifications, to remain aligned with institutional goals. I would appreciate any guidance from my mentor on how to stay proactively aligned with strategic priorities and initiatives as they evolve, ensuring that I am well-prepared to support MD Anderson’s goals.

## 3. Developing Leadership Strategies for Team Effectiveness
Learning practical leadership techniques to address team dynamics and resolve specific issues effectively is a valuable growth area. Mentorship provides an opportunity to discuss challenges and gain insights into best practices for fostering a productive team environment. Additionally, it would be beneficial if my mentor could recommend opportunities for me to take on leadership responsibilities in collaborative projects to apply and refine these strategies.

# Personal Background

## Cultural and Educational Background
Belonging to the Mongolian ethnicity and originally from the Mongolian autonomous region in northern China, I have been in the United States for 15 years. I earned an M.S. in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).

## Professional Journey
After completing my Ph.D., I spent a year working at the Molecular Imaging Center at UCLA. I then joined MD Anderson’s proton center as a Proton Therapy Fellow under Dr. Sahoo. Upon completing the fellowship, I transitioned to IROC, where I worked with Steven Kry and Paige Taylor, focusing on quality assurance (QA) system management and development.

## Current Role and Responsibilities
Now a member of the architecture team, my primary responsibilities include providing high-performance computing services using Kubernetes and programming for EPIC’s Chronicle database. My role centers on optimizing computing solutions to support MD Anderson's data-intensive needs and enhance operational efficiency.

# Initial Meeting Agenda

## Purpose
As Dr.Chung has a very busy schedule, the purpose of our first conversation is to establish a mutual understanding of my goals and how she can best support my professional growth.

## Discussion Topics
During the initial meeting, I hope to discuss the following:
- **Current Challenges and Areas for Improvement**: Share my current role’s challenges and areas where I seek growth, particularly in cross-department collaboration and leadership strategies.
- **Learning Objectives and Skill Development**: Outline specific skills I aim to develop, both technical (e.g., data science) and soft skills (e.g., team leadership).
- **Expectations and Outcomes**: Discuss the outcomes I hope to achieve through this mentorship and ways to measure progress.
- **Preferred Mentorship Style**: Seek her feedback on the preferred format and frequency of communication, as well as her recommendations for structuring our mentorship sessions.
  
## Next Steps
I aim to collaboratively establish a flexible mentorship plan based on her availability, ensuring that our interactions are efficient and mutually beneficial. This conversation will serve as a foundation for setting realistic goals, timelines, and checkpoints in alignment with her schedule.
